## Contributing

To add a new language, create a folder at the root directory. Add any package managers, dependencies, code, etc to that folder.
If a deployment is required (publish a package, create release tag, etc) then create a new github workflow `.github/workflows/<lang>-release.yml` with appropriate steps.
